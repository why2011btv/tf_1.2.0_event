Text	Andre Iguodala hopped on the scorer 's table and played to the crowd as the catchy 76ers ' anthem blared in the arena . His teammates joined Iguodala and danced along as confetti fluttered around them . `` Number one , Philadelphia . Here they come , team of the year . '' Team of the first round , for sure . Eight years of going home empty in April is over . The Sixers at last had a reason to go wild . Iguodala made the go-ahead free throws with 2.2 seconds left and Philadelphia rallied for a 79-78 victory over the top-seeded Chicago Bulls in Game 6 on Thursday night , advancing to the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs for the first time since 2003 . The 76ers will face Boston , which beat Atlanta in six games , in the conference semifinals . `` I do n't know how we won this game , '' coach Doug Collins said . Collins and the Sixers hardly cared the series win comes with an asterisk . The Bulls lost reigning MVP Derrick Rose to a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee late in their Game 1 win . Center Joakim Noah missed the last three games with a sprained left ankle . `` I thought we had more than enough to win with , '' Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said . `` I 'm disappointed in the loss but I 'm not disappointed in our team . '' Without their stars , the Bulls found it tough to gut one out against the Sixers . Omer Asik missed two free throws for the Bulls with 7 seconds left that would have given them a three-point lead . Iguodala grabbed the second miss , sprinted the length of the court , and was fouled by Asik on the driving layup . The Sixers put their season in the hands of one of the worst fourth-quarter free-throw shooters in the NBA . Collins was hunched over and his hands clasped with Iguodala at the line . He made both â€” and 20,362 fans went absolutely wild . Iguodala made nine of 10 free throws in the fourth quarter in this series after shooting 45 percent ( 23 of 51 ) from the line in the period this season . Iguodala changed his approach at the line this series . He started thinking what it would be like to teach his son how to shoot free throws . Dads do n't miss . `` I was like , 'Son , this is how you shoot free throws , ' '' Iguodala said . The Sixers are the fifth No . 8 seed to win a first-round series against a No . 1 seed . Memphis eliminated San Antonio last season , while Golden State ( 2007 ) , New York ( 1999 ) and Denver ( 1994 ) also pulled off the rare feat . In his second season , Collins had already led the Sixers to their first winning season in seven years . Now , it 's on to the second round for the first time since Allen Iverson was an All-Star . The Sixers were smiling and mobbed each other as they dashed to the locker room to keep the party going . The Sixers were 2.2 seconds from playing Game 7 in Chicago . Now , they will pack their bags for the second round . They went 2-1 against the Celtics this season . Collins had a catch in his voice at the postgame podium and was joined by his 4-year-old grandson , Cooper . Collins rubbed his head and held back tears talking about faith , family and his guys in the locker room . `` I 'm a Sixer for life , '' he said . Iguodala scored 20 points , and Jrue Holiday and Lou Williams each scored 14 for the Sixers who were outrebounded 56-33 . Iguodala snagged the one that mattered . `` We win on a rebound . Something we do n't get all night , '' a smiling Collins said . The Sixers started 20-9 and led the Atlantic Division for the first half of the season until a late fade sent them tumbling toward eighth place . None of that matters now . Not even the fact the Bulls were down two stars . The 50-win Bulls are heading home early a year after they reached the conference finals . `` We were on the ropes and we battled , '' forward Carlos Boozer said . `` In the end , it came down to the very last second . So , it 's tough . We were right there , given everything , right there . It will be a long summer . '' Luol Deng had 19 points and 17 rebounds for the Bulls . Richard Hamilton scored 19 points and Boozer grabbed 13 rebounds . The Bulls had the lock-down defensive effort to nearly pull off the win . The signature series came in the fourth quarter when the Sixers wasted a forced turnover on the other end with a brutal offensive possession . Spencer Hawes missed a shot , Thaddeus Young missed two straight in the paint , and Hawes missed again against hands-up defense that sent the bench into a frenzy . Noah was the first one up pumping his fist and screaming encouragement for the fantastic defensive effort . Hawes fired an airball next time down and there was a collective groan from the crowd . Iguodala made up for a string of Sixers misses with a tying 3 that made it 70-all . The Sixers tried to get a laugh by showing the Bulls bench on `` Kiss Cam . '' Noah popped his warmup jacket toward the camera and the crowd booed the oversized `` Chicago '' on the big screen . Noah was one of the top offensive rebounders in the league and the Bulls figured on missing his presence in the middle . Led by Deng and Boozer , the Bulls instead went out and controlled the boards , holding a 49-29 edge early in the fourth . `` We have to use this as motivation to move forward , '' Thibodeau said . Notes : The Sixers scored a measly 26 first-half points in their Game 5 loss . They led Game 6 48-40 at halftime . The Sixers started 12 of 20 from the field and finished the half at 50 percent . They shot a season-low 32 percent in Game 5 and failed to shoot better than 40 percent in three other games .
