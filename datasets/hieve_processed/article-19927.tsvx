Text	At least four people were wounded on Wednesday , May 16 in clashes between the army and residents of two areas of Lebanon 's city of Tripoli supporting opposite sides in the crisis in neighbouring Syria , a security official said , according to AFP . The official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said shooting broke out after soldiers tried to remove barricades in the northern port city 's sensitive and mainly Sunni Muslim neighbourhood of Bab al-Tebbaneh . Residents opened fire on the soldiers , one of whom was wounded , and the troops responded . The clashes then escalated with residents of Jabal Mohsen , which sits opposite Bab al-Tebbaneh , also opening fire . There were also reports of sniper fire . Jabal Mohsen is populated mainly by Alawites loyal to the embattled regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , while Bab al-Tebbaneh residents support the opposition seeking to oust Assad . Clashes between residents of the two neighbourhoods earlier this week left nine people dead and some 50 wounded . Heydar Aliyev would never tolerate such unbridled anti-Armenian sentiment which is now spread in Azerbaijan .
